    "### In challenging times of covid-19 crisis, it is safe to avoid Dine-in in restaurants, and also immportant to support our Houston, TX  local businesses. More and more people choose to find the food and order from restaurants easily with apps and deliver to home . Although there are couple of apps support this service like Uber Eats, Doordash, and GrubHub, it is far short of such platforms to satisfy the market's needs. To develop restaurants delivery platforms and start the business is not easy. Let's start step by step. For this project, we will only cover the first step, which is to cluster restaurants and to find potential customers by income in different zip codes area. "

In the begining stage of the new business, we don't want to cover all residents with shorts of hand. The goal is to provide excellent service with reasonal price. One option is to collect the income data by different zip codes in Houston. And we can forcus on residents with a certain range of income. Median Household income in Houston by zip code can be find from http://www.houstonstateofhealth.com/indicators/index/view?indicatorId=315&localeId=38539 . the .CSV data (Download Zip Code Indicator Data CSV )can also be downloaded. After getting the data, we will clean, group by zip code and calculate the median income in eacg zip code. By sorting certain of range income, we can target our potential costomers. \n"

We can find the rate, cost, tips, etc. in their API. Here, I will use Foursquare API that can provide comprehensive and straight-forward data. This API contains massive dataset of accurate location data and being used widely by developers. To achieve our goal to set up the platform, we will use Foursquare Houston restaurants data. \n",
